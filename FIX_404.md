# Fix 404 Error on Vercel

## Problem
Your app shows 404 error because Vercel doesn't know where to find the built files.

## Solution Applied

1. ✅ Updated `vercel.json` with correct routing for SPA
2. ✅ Committed and pushed changes to GitHub

## Vercel Dashboard Settings

Go to your Vercel project settings and verify:

### Build & Development Settings

1. **Framework Preset:** `Create React App`
2. **Build Command:** `npm run build` or `react-scripts build`
3. **Output Directory:** `build`
4. **Install Command:** `npm install`

### Root Directory

Make sure **Root Directory** is set to `./` (project root)

## If Still 404

### Option 1: Manual Redeploy
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Deployments
2. Find latest deployment
3. Click "..." → "Redeploy"
4. Wait for build to complete

### Option 2: Check Build Logs
1. Click "Build Logs" on deployment page
2. Look for errors
3. Ensure build completed successfully

### Option 3: Verify vercel.json
The file should contain:
```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/static/(.*)",
      "headers": {
        "cache-control": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
      },
      "dest": "/static/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Expected Result

After redeployment:
- ✅ https://posts-app-ivory.vercel.app/ → Shows login page
- ✅ https://posts-app-ivory.vercel.app/posts → Shows posts (after login)
- ✅ https://posts-app-ivory.vercel.app/about → Shows about page

## Next Steps

1. Wait 1-2 minutes for auto-deployment
2. Refresh https://posts-app-ivory.vercel.app/
3. If still 404, manually redeploy from Vercel dashboard
4. Check build logs for errors

The changes have been pushed to GitHub. Vercel should automatically redeploy! 🚀
